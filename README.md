<h1>Hi, I'm Greg Shoda!<br/> <a href="https://github.com/gdshoda">Data Science Graduate Student</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregory-shoda-36516617a/">Mortgage Systems Analyst</a></h1>

Hello, my name is Greg Shoda. I have bachelor's degrees in French and Physics, and speak French fluently. I have been learning Japanese for two years and have found learning Japanese very rewarding. I play tennis once or twice a week throughout the year and enjoy playing and watching all sports!

I am a strong python programmer and am very experienced with getting data into the right types and combining different datasets to gain insight from them. I am adept with SQL queries and data modeling. I also am very good with data visualization through Python or Power BI.

Most of my programming happens at work or for school assignments, but I am making a concerted effort to work on personal projects to get more familiar with different data technologies, and showcase my skills and hobbies in this portfolio.
